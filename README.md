The code is written in C++.

- GitHub repository: [Engine](https://github.com/Beautiful-Engines/Engine)

### Features

#### Game Objects
- Drag fbx creates a new GameObject with mesh and material.
- Drag texture with Game Object selected applies the texture to it.
- All GameObjects appear at Hierarchy with inheritance structure.
- GameObject/3D Objects menu to create primitive shapes (Cube doesn't have uv).
- Activate/Deactivate Game Object components on Inspector.

#### Render Mode

In this menu you can enable and disable:
	- Depth
	- Cull Face
	- Lightning
	- Color
	- Textures
	- Normals
	- Wireframe	
	
If something is not working as expected, please, revise console panel to understand what is happening.
If, after that, you assume the engine is running an error, revise issues or send a new one (we would be very grateful).
